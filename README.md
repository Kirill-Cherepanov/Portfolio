## What I've built and have learned

- Created a fully responsive web portfolio with a lot of 3D components.
- Used a lot of optimization techniques to prevent the website from being unusable on low-end devices.
- Designed the website in two pleasing color themes: light and dark, made a seamless transition between them (on higher-end devices).
- Used a variety of 3D components and unique 2D animations and effects to make a stunning impression on a user.

## My general thoughts

The idea was to make a 3D website or a website with a lot of 3D features, and here we are right now. It much longer than it should've taken. I had to think of how I would implement whatever I wanted to without react first, than think of how to do it in react. The second part often took much longer than the first, due to react/fiber and react/drei not having comprehensive documentation.

Also, I never really thought that three.js could be so demanding in terms of CPU and GPU, that's why I was pretty shocked when I realized that the website lags quite a bit even on my high-end laptop. Perhaps I went overboard with all the stuff that I added. I just wanted a cool first impression, and now it could be even worse than the most simple website if the person I'm trying to impress uses a slow device.

You may notice that the repository doesn't have many commits and most of them are done within a span of a few days. The reason is simple, it feels very tedious to think about when to commit, how to name a commit, whether to reset a previous commit due to it not being big enough, or being too large or reverting most of it's changes. In other words, I don't like git all that much, so I prefer doing work without it, when possible.
