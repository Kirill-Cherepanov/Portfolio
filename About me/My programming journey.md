# My programming journey

My software development journey has started in 2020. I had more time than usual during the pandemic and put it into learning Python. That's when I wrote my first more or less serious project - a [Chess game](https://github.com/Kirill-Cherepanov/Python-chess-v2).

Fast forward to 2021 and I joined free web development courses at Rolling Scopes School. There I learned the basics of web development: HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, Figma, and Git. I was doing pretty well until halfway through the course, which is one year long. My life took a difficult turn at that time, leaving me with almost no free time. A month and a half later, when I sort of managed to figure everything out, I was already very far behind the schedule and was expelled as a result.

And now fast forward to the beginning of 2022. That's when I decided to continue studying web development on my own. First I learned Webpack, Typescript and partially Express with Socket.io utilizing these skills in this project: [Tic-tac-toe 1](https://github.com/Kirill-Cherepanov/tic-tac-toe-game), [Tic-tac-toe 2](https://github.com/Kirill-Cherepanov/tic-tac-toe-multiplayer). The second one was built at the same time as the first but I couldn't manage to finish it. Therefore, I decided not to push it to github only to reverse that decision a few months later.

Summer of 2022 was the time when I started studying React. Among the projects that I've built with it are [Meme generator](https://github.com/Kirill-Cherepanov/meme-generator), [E-commerce website](https://github.com/Kirill-Cherepanov/luxury-pens-e-commerce), a finaly finished [remake of Tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/Kirill-Cherepanov/tic-tac-toe-multiplayer-react), [my Portfolio webiste](), and [Bloggy](https://github.com/Kirill-Cherepanov/Bloggy), the one I'm most proud of yet.

Oh, and I also learned C++ at university. I don't have any notable projects built with it, but it certainly helped me a lot with understanding the foundation of modern programming.
