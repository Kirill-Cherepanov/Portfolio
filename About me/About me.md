# About me

## Brief and formal:

I'm a software engineer passionate about developing apps of small and large. My main strength is web front-end, especially with React framework. I build websites with a keen eye on design and overall user experience, as well as future maintainability of the codebase.

## Informal

Hello there, my name is Kirill Cherepanov, and I'm a junior full stack web developer with an emphasis on front-end and MERN plus Typescript stack. Here is my [full list of skills]() and [projects]().

I'm a junior (3rd year) at Belarussian State University studying theoretical mechanics and mathematical modeling. Despite that I have quite a lot of time on my hands - thanks to the very flexible curriculum - that I put into studying web development. It is my entrepreneurial mindset and drive for constant improvement that propel me forward and motivate me to take on increasingly challenging projects. Be it software, data science, or mathematics - I enjoy learning all of it by solving related problems.

As a child, I was fascinated by all the technological advances around me, often finding myself dreaming for hours about the endless possibilities that technology provides. I've stayed true to that childhood dream, and even now the sincerest desire I harbor is to observe the evolution of human technology and improve myself alongside it. I'm very excited about what the future might bring to us, and I want to witness and experience the most of that myself.

About 6 years ago, I decided to take a serious approach to studying English. Since then, I have been constantly studying through periods of active and passive learning via self-exposure to western media and book reading, all of which I grew accustomed to and they became my favorite pastimes at this point. Although my lack of experience in the speech department is inevitable, since I have not yet had enough opportunities to communicate with native speakers, I still take great pride in my relatively abundant vocabulary (for a non-native, that is) and a knack for writing English texts. I also tried learning other languages, such as Japanese. For now, though, I decided to double down on learning English to finally get rid of the remnants of my accent and improve my ability to read more difficult books (e.g. Lovecraft).

Regarding my pastimes and passions.

- I love listening to almost every kind of music - in fact I probably listen to it too much, to the point of not being able to sit in silence - ranging from hard rock to classical music, and from country to technological to [A cappella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_cappella). I also enjoy playing rhythm games at times.
- To keep myself in touch with the world I regularly read and listen to news articles, as well as literature on many different fields of study such as economics, physics, psychology, history, and many others.
- I also enjoy reading - mainly novels, but not exclusively - having read over 60 volumes in 2021.

## What I like:

I love listening to almost every kind of music - in fact I probably listen to it too much, to the point of feeling addicted - ranging from hard rock to classical music, and from country to technological. I also enjoy playing rhythm games at times.

I take a habit of reading and listening to articles in many various fields of studies, such as economics, physics, psychology, history, among many others to keep myself in touch with the world.

I've been trying myself in learning other languages, such as Japanese, for example. For now I decided to postpone learning other languages in order to double down on English and finally get rid of the remnants of my accent.

I also enjoy reading books - mostly novels - having read over 60 volumes over the 2021.
